Event Horizon Finder using Pseudospectral methods.
(for previous versions with finite-differencing, see LVLST)

-	SHF: an event horizon finder that uses pseudospectral method.
	Data in SHF are mostly vectorized to reduce computational time.
	
03/25/2012
-	Uses cubic spline interpolation subroutines from 
	http://orion.math.iastate.edu/burkardt/f_src/spline/spline.html
	written by John Burkardt

04/07/2012
-	Parallelized the code with OpenMP

04/30/2012
-	Uses LAPACK calls to calculate the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse.
-	Uses the pseudoinverse to evolve the data.

-       Added routines to read HDF5 metric outputted by CactusCode
        2 versions: ReadHDF5Metric.f90 --> uses generic HDF5 calls (USE HDF5)
                    ReadHDF5MetricLite.f90 --> Uses HDF5Lite calls which are easier (USE H5LT as well)
                    The former is more robust because it is compatible with
                    HDF5 version 1.6.x (on Ranger)
