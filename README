Event Horizon Finder using Pseudospectral methods.
(for previous versions with finite-differencing, see LVLST)

03/12/2012
-	SHF: an event horizon finder that uses pseudospectral method.
	Data in SHF are mostly vectorized to reduce computational time.
	
04/07/2012
-	Parallelized the code with OpenMP

04/30/2012
-	Uses LAPACK calls to calculate the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse.
-	Uses the pseudoinverse to evolve the data.

-       Added routines to read HDF5 metric outputted by CactusCode
        2 versions: ReadHDF5Metric.f90 --> uses generic HDF5 calls (USE HDF5)
                    ReadHDF5MetricLite.f90 --> Uses HDF5Lite calls which are easier (USE H5LT as well)
                    The former is more robust because it is compatible with
                    HDF5 version 1.6.x (on Ranger)

06/13/2012
-       Added temporal metric interpolation routine to satisfy Courant's condition
-       Allowed for pi-symmetry in HDF5 metric data
-       New SSPRK routine: SSPRK(5,4) which has larger cfl value

09/05/2012
-       Fixed bug in getting metric data
-       Made the functions that get and read the metric data much nicer; 
        there's no need for using the HDF5 tools

-       Optimize using SHTns: http://users.isterre.fr/nschaeff/SHTns/
