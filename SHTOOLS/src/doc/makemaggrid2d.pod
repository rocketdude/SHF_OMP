=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<MakeMagGrid2D> will create 2-dimensional cylindrical maps of all three components and total field corresponding to a set of magnetic potential spherical harmonic coefficients. The magnetic potential is given by

V = R0 Sum_{l=1}^LMAX (R0/r)^{l+1} Sum_{m=-l}^l C_{lm} Y_{lm}.

The output grids are in (geocentric) raster format possessing upper-left and lower-right coordinates of (90 N, 0 E) and (90 S, 360 E), respectively. If the optional parameters NORTH, SOUTH, EAST and WEST are specified, then the output grid will possess upper-left and lower-right coordinates of (NORTH, WEST) and (SOUTH, EAST), repsectively. The employed spherical harmonic normalization and Condon-Shortley phase convention is set to use Schmidt semi-normalized 4-pi harmonics that exclude the phase of (-1)^m. The field is calculated on the surface of an ellispoid with semis-major axis A and flattening F. Note that these calculations are strictly exact only when all points on the flattened ellipsoid are greater than the maximum radius of the planet.

=over 11

=item RAD

(output) REAL*8, DIMENSION(180/INTERVAL+1, 360/INTERVAL+1)

A 2D equally spaced map of the radial component of the magnetic field corresponding to the input spherical harmonic coefficients CILM. The  array is in raster format with upper-left and lower-right coordinates of (90 N, 0 E) and (90 S, 360 E), respectively. Latitudinal coordinates are geocentric.

=item PHI

(output) REAL*8, DIMENSION(180/INTERVAL+1, 360/INTERVAL+1)

A 2D equally spaced map of the phi (N-S) component of the magnetic field corresponding to the input spherical harmonic coefficients CILM. 

=item THETA

(output) REAL*8, DIMENSION(180/INTERVAL+1, 360/INTERVAL+1)

A 2D equally spaced map of the theta (E-W) component of the magnetic field corresponding to the input spherical harmonic coefficients CILM.

=item TOTAL

(output) REAL*8, DIMENSION(180/INTERVAL+1, 360/INTERVAL+1)

A 2D equally spaced map of the total magnetic field corresponding to the input spherical harmonic coefficients CILM. 

=item CILM 

(input) REAL*8, DIMENSION (2, LMAX+1, LMAX+1)

The real Schmidt semi-normalized spherical harmonic coefficients to be expanded in the space domain. The coefficients C1lm and C2lm refer to the "cosine" (Clm) and "sine" (Slm) coefficients, respectively, with Clm = CILM(1, l+1, m+1) and Slm = CILM(2, l+1, m+1). Alternatively, C1lm and C2lm correspond to the positive and negative order coefficients, respectively.
