=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<DHaj> will calculate the latitudinal weights used in the spherical harmonic transform of Driscoll and Healy (1994; equation 9). The number of samples N must be even, and the transform and its inverse are implemented as I<SHExpandDH> and I<MakeGridDH>, respectively. It is noted that the first element, corresponding to the north pole, is always zero. The element corresponding to the south pole is not included.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 10

=item N

(input) INTEGER

The number of samples in latitude used in the spherical harmonic transform. This must be EVEN.
	
=item AJ

(output) REAL*8, DIMENSION (N)

The latitudinal weights used in the spherical harmonic transform.
