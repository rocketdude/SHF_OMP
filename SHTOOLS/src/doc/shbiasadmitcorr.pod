=head1 DESCRIPTION

Given the global cross-power spectra Sgt, Sgg and Stt of two functions G and T, I<SHBiasAdmitCorr> will calculate the expected multitaper admittance and correlation spectra associated with the two global functions. This routine expects as input a matrix containing the spherical harmonic coefficients of the localizing windows, which can be generated by a call to I<SHReturnTapers> or I<SHReturnTapersM>. Only the K best-concentrated localization windows will be employed when calculating the biassed cross-power spectra. The maximum calculated degree of the biassed multitapered admittance and correlation spectra corresponds to LMAX-LWIN, as it is assumed that the input cross-power spectra beyond LMAX are unknown, and not zero.

Two manners of calculating the localized admittance and correlation spectra are possible according to the value of the optional parameter MTDEF. In case 1, the multitaper cross-power spectra of Sgt, Sgg, and Stt are first calculated, and from these, the admittance and correlation spectra are formed. In case 2, the biassed admittance and correlation spectra are calculated for each individual taper, and these are then averaged to obtain the biassed multitaper admittance and correlation spectra.

The default is to apply equal weights to each individual windowed estimate of the spectrum, but this can be modified when MTDEF is 1 by specifying the weights in the optional argument TAPER_WT. The weights must sum to unity and can be calculated by I<SHMTVarOpt> or I<SHMTVarOpt>.


=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 14

=item TAPERS

(input) REAL*8, DIMENSION (LWIN+1, K)

The spherical coefficients of the localizing windows. Each column corresponds to the non-zero coefficients of a single angular order. Since all that is important is the power spectrum of each window, the exact angular order is not important. These are generated by a call to I<SHReturnTapers> or I<SHReturnTapersM>.

=item LWIN

(input) INTEGER

The spherical harmonic bandwidth of the localizing windows.

=item K

(input) INTEGER

The number of localizing windows to use. Only the first K columns of TAPERS will be employed, which corresponds to the K best-concentrated localizing windows.
	
=item INCSPECTRA

(input) REAL*8, DIMENSION (LDATA+1)

The global unwindowed power spectrum.

=item LDATA

(input) INTEGER

The maximum degree of the global unwindowed power spectrum.

=item OUTCSPECTRA

(output) REAL*8, DIMENSION (*)

The expectation of the multitaper localized power spectrum. The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the output is min(LDATA+LWIN, SIZE(OUTSCSPECTRA)-1).

=item TAPER_WT

(input) REAL*8, OPTIONAL, DIMENSION (K)

The weights to apply to each individual windowed spectral estimate. The weights must sum to unity and are obtained from I<SHMTVarOpt> or I<SHMTVarOpt0>.
