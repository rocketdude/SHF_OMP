=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<MakeGravGrid2D> will create a 2-dimensional cylindrical map, equally spaced in (geocentric) latitude and longitude, of either the gravitational potential, radial gravity, or all three components of the gravitational vector (in geocentric coordinates). The gravitational potential is given by

V = GM/r Sum_{l=0}^LMAX (R0/r)^l Sum_{m=-l}^l C_{lm} Y_{lm}.

The coefficients are referenced to a radius R0, and the function is computed on a flattened ellipsoid with semi-major axis A (i.e., the mean equatorial radius) and flattening F. If the entire radial gravitational acceleration is to be calculated, it is necessary that the degree-0 term be set equal to 1. When the radial gravity is output, the values are in SI units (m/s^2, to convert to mGals multiply by 10^5), and the sign is positive when directed upwards. If the optional angular rotation rate OMEGA is specified, the potential and radial gravitational acceleration will be calculated in a body-fixed rotating reference frame.

The other two components and magnitude of the gravitational field can be calculated by specifying the optional arrays THETA, PHI, and TOTAL. In this case, all three optional parameters must be specified. To remove the "normal gravity" (total gravitational acceleration on the ellipsoid) from the magnitude of the total gravity field (to obtain the "gravity disturbance"), set NORMAL_GRAVITY equal to 1.

The calculated values should be considered exact only when the radii on the ellipsoid are less than the maximum radius of the planet (the potential coefficients are simply downward continued in the spectral domain). Furthermore, the components of gravity vector are calculated along a vector whose origin is at the center of the planet; the components are not normal to the reference ellipsoid.

The output grid is in raster format possessing upper-left and lower-right coordinates of (90 N, 0 E) and (90 S, 360 E), respectively. If the optional parameters NORTH, SOUTH, EAST and WEST are specified, then the output grid will possess upper-left and lower-right coordinates of (NORTH, WEST) and (SOUTH, EAST), respectively. The employed spherical harmonic normalization and Condon-Shortley phase convention use the default geodesy 4-pi normalized harmonics that exclude the Condon-Shortley phase of (-1)^m. 

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 11

=item RAD

(output) REAL*8, DIMENSION(180/INTERVAL+1, 360/INTERVAL+1)

A 2D equally spaced map of the radial gravity or gravitational potential corresponding to the input spherical harmonic coefficients CILM. The  array is in raster format with upper-left and lower-right coordinates of (90 N, 0 E) and (90 S, 360 E), respectively. The output is in SI units (i.e., m^2/s^2 for the potential, and m/s^2 for the gravity).

=item CILM 

(input) REAL*8, DIMENSION (2, LMAX+1, LMAX+1)

The real gravitational potential spherical harmonic coefficients to be expanded in the space domain. The coefficients C1lm and C2lm refer to the "cosine" (Clm) and "sine" (Slm) coefficients, respectively, with Clm = CILM(1, l+1, m+1) and Slm = CILM(2, l+1, m+1). Alternatively, C1lm and C2lm correspond to the positive and negative order coefficients, respectively.

=item NORMAL_GRAVITY

(input) INTEGER, OPTIONAL

If 1, the normal gravity (gravitational acceleration on the ellipsoid) will be subtracted from the total gravity, yielding the "gravity disturbance." This is done using Somigliana's formula (after converting geocentric to geodetic coordinates).
