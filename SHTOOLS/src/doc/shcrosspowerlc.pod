=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<SHCrossPowerLC> will calculate the spectral cross-power of two functions expressed in complex spherical harmonics for a single degree L. This is explicitly calculated as:

Sum_{i=1}^2 Sum_{m=0}^L C1(i, L+1, m+1) * conjg[C2(i, L+1, m+1)] .

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 10

=item C1

(input) COMPLEX*16, DIMENSION (2, L+1, L+1)

The first function expressed in complex spherical harmonics.

=item C2

(input) COMPLEX*16, DIMENSION (2, L+1, L+1)

The second function expressed in complex spherical harmonics.
	
=item L

(input) INTEGER

The spherical harmonic degree for which the cross power will be calculated.
