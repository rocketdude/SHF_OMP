=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<SHrtoc> will convert real spherical harmonics to complex form. By default, the dimension of the output array is the minimum of RCILM and CCILM, though this can be changed by specifying the optional parameter DEGMAX. The normalization of the input and output coefficients are by default the same, but if the optional argument CONVENTION is set to 2, this routine will convert from geodesy 4-pi normalized coefficients to orthonormalized coefficients. The Condon-Shortley phase convention between the input an output coefficients can be modified by the optional argument SWITCHCS.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 13

=item RCILM

(input) REAL*8, DIMENSION (2, *, *)

The input real spherical harmonic coefficients. S<RCILM(1, *, *)> and S<RCILM(2, *, *)> correspond to the COS and SIN terms, respectively.
	
=item CCILM

(output) REAL*8, DIMENSION (2, *, *)

The output complex spherical harmonic coefficients. S<CCILM(1, *, *)> and S<CCILM(2, *, *)> correspond to the real and complex part of the coefficients, respectively. Only the positive angular orders are output; the negative orders can be calculated from the relation C_{l-m} = (-1)^m C_{lm}^*.

=item DEGMAX

(input) INTEGER, OPTIONAL

The maximum degree of the output coefficients. By default, the dimension of the output coefficients will be the smallest of RCILM and CCILM.

=item CONVENTION

(input) INTEGER, OPTIONAL

If 1 (default), the input and output coefficients will have the same normalization. If 2, real geodesy 4-pi coefficients will be converted to complex orthonormal form.

=item SWTICHCS

(input) INTEGER, OPTIONAL

If 0 (default), the input and output coefficients will possess the same Condon-Shortley phase convention. If 1, the input coefficients will first be multiplied by (-1)^m.
